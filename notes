My first note
I have a working app with a frontend and backend.

Here's the frontend code:
....

....

Here's the backend code:
....

....

I want to.....

Give me all frontend, backend and database code as complete files that I can copy and paste.
When giving  me database code: include the USE command at the beginning.

For cors, make the backend accept all requests. For the DB, use ... and the same credentials as in
my backend code

For the frontend, don't use tailwind, just use vanilla styling. For styling, ensure that the text is readable on the background..
