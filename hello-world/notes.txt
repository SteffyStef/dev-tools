My first note
I have a working app with a frontend and backend. 

Here's the frontend code:
....

....

Here's the backend code:
....

....

I want to.....

Give me all frontend, backend and database code as complete files that I can copy and paste.
When giving  me database code: include the USE command at the beginning.

For cors, make the backend accept all requests. For the DB, use ... and the same credentials as in 
my backend code.
